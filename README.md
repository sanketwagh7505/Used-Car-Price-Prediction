# Used Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as mileage, brand, model year, and more. It utilizes data processing, visualization, and machine learning techniques to build an effective regression model.

## Features

- **Data Handling**: Loading and preprocessing data from a CSV file.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and distributions using libraries like Seaborn and Plotly.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Training regression models to predict car prices accurately.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset (`cardekho_imputated.csv`) and inspecting it for missing or irrelevant data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing relationships and trends in the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve model performance.
5. **Model Training**: Training regression models and optimizing them.
6. **Evaluation**: Measuring the performance of the models using evaluation metrics.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly`
- `scikit-learn`

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the analysis and train models.

## Results

The project evaluates various regression models and provides insights into their performance. The best-performing model is highlighted based on evaluation metrics.
